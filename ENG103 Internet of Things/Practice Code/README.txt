Project: Practice Code
Term: Semester 2 2023 (Jul - Nov)
---------------------------------------
Python programs written in first-year as practice. Made mostly to learn and grasp basic coding concepts and to start thinking as programmer. Redimentary programs, not enough comments to explain how program functions. 

Helped me develop a good basic understanding of programming concepts like different types of loops, conditions, variabls, and functions.

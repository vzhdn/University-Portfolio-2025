Project: Practice Code
Term: Semester 2 2023 (Jul - Nov)
---------------------------------------

Python programs written in first-year as practice. Made mostly to learn and grasp basic coding concepts and to start thinking as programmer. Redimentary programs, not enough comments to explain how program functions. 

Helped me develop a good basic understanding of programming concepts like different types of loops, conditions, variabls, and functions. 

12 Days of Christmas - Recite classic "12 Days of Christmas" poem using lists and loops.

cloths - Prints every clothing combination using for loops and lists.

Currency - Converts AUD currency into USD, EUR, GDP and INR

def_prime_num - Requests integer input from user, and returns if it is a prime number or not

dice_simulation - Simulates throwing a pair of die x times. Requests int input from user to determine how many rolls, and returns the number each possible combination was rolled. Note: As it will always roll two dice, the lowest possible number it can roll is 2.

graph_test - *Must run random_csv.py before running graph_test* Creates graph using data.csv file using Pandas and MatPlotLib. Simulates chart generated from pulse oximeter reading.

name_upper_lower - Requests user string input (name). Formats input to be lowercase, upper case and returns number of characters in string.

random_csv - Generates CSV file populated with increasing but random numbers. Runs until program is closed. This is an oversight and I could have easily added a condition to stop the generation after x iterations.

twilio-notification-code - Tests Twilio SMS message function. Not functional as I have deleted API and numbers for confidentiality.

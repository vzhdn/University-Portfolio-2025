Project: Text-Based Adventure Game
Term: Semester 1 2024 (Feb - Jun)
---------------------------------------

A text-based adventure game. You are tasked with finding key items, completing tasks and navigating to a specific room to complete the game. Players can move, interact with certain objects, pick up/drop and use items. 

This game was my one of my first attempts at creating a program that has more than one file. That is to say, the codebase is spread across multiple files instead of being stuffed into one file. Compared to my code from 2023, an immediate noticable difference is there are more comments explaining code function

game - Functions used through-out the game. Contains main loop for playing the game. 

gameCode - Player class and main commands used for game. 

roomData - Room class and all room init. 

roomDescriptions - Contains room, ite, and task descriptions, as well as interactions.

game_map_v4 - Game map image. Opened in-game when player uses map. Unfortunatly this function does not work...

Text-based Game report - Technical report of text-based game.
